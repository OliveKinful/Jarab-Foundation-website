            <p>In 2019, JARAB Foundation conducted an inquiry into the tenets of poverty in underserved communities in Ghana and how it can be eradicated. They discovered that the low sense of achievement and financial challenges aggravates poverty in these communities.  That is, due to the low sense of achievement and financial challenges, the majority of the children do not pursue tertiary education, thereby reducing their chances of harnessing their dreams and aspirations, and also of getting lucrative jobs to improve their standard of living to contribute to socio-economic development in their families and the community. This means tackling the issue of the low sense of achievement among children in these communities and supporting them financially to pursue tertiary education can contribute to eradicating poverty in underserved communities and the world. This inspired the JARAB initiative. 
            The JARAB foundation seeks to address the issue of the low sense of achievement among children in rural communities in Ghana to contribute to the reduction of poverty. We engage the basic and the senior high school students in the rural communities in Ghana in innovative mentorship initiatives and advocates to empower these children to look beyond their current state and then strife to actualize their dreams and aspirations to turn the tide of poverty in their families, community and the world at large.  Projects at JARAB Foundation include; Peer Mentorship, Back to School Donation, Campaign for zero teenage pregnancy, Career coaching, and Menstrual Hygiene campaigns.
