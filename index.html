    <div class="grid-2-col">
        <div class="article">
            <p>In 2019, JARAB Foundation conducted an inquiry into the tenets of poverty in underserved communities in
                Ghana and how it can be eradicated. They discovered that the low sense of achievement and financial
                challenges aggravates poverty in these communities. That is, due to the low sense of achievement and
                financial challenges, the majority of the children do not pursue tertiary education, thereby reducing
                their chances of harnessing their dreams and aspirations, and also of getting lucrative jobs to improve
                their standard of living to contribute to socio-economic development in their families and the
                community. This means tackling the issue of the low sense of achievement among children in these
                communities and supporting them financially to pursue tertiary education can contribute to eradicating
                poverty in underserved communities and the world. This inspired the JARAB initiative.
                The JARAB foundation seeks to address the issue of the low sense of achievement among children in rural
                communities in Ghana to contribute to the reduction of poverty. We engage the basic and the senior high
                school students in the rural communities in Ghana in innovative mentorship initiatives and advocates to
                empower these children to look beyond their current state and then strife to actualize their dreams and
                aspirations to turn the tide of poverty in their families, community and the world at large. Projects at
                JARAB Foundation include; Peer Mentorship, Back to School Donation, Campaign for zero teenage pregnancy,
                Career coaching, and Menstrual Hygiene campaigns.

                <h4><b>Menstrual Hygiene Sensitization</b></h4>
                <p>The Menstrual Hygiene Campaign at JARAB Foundation is an advocacy program that seeks to contribute to the reduction of girls in the rural communities in Ghana who miss school during menstruation. In Ghana, 95% of girls sometimes miss school due to menstruation (Ghana Research Briefs, 2016). This initiative seeks to contribute to the reduction of this problem. We believe by changing misconceptions about menstruation, encouraging parents to discuss issues relating to menstruation at home, and guiding girls to manage menstruation will go a long way to help address this problem and end period poverty.
                    The 2022 campaign was held at Amosima and Brafoyaw in the Central Region of Ghana. We engaged 200 girls in period talks. In addition, we engaged 100 parents on the need to discuss menstruation at home and why they should provide a sanitary pad for their female children. We donated sanitary pads to some girls.</p>

                <p>The Success Journey is a mentorship initiative at The JARAB Foundation where we guide freshmen and freshwomen at the tertiary institutions to start their tertiary education smart and end well. The 2022 edition was held on 29th January 2022 at University of Cape Coast. We had brilliant Teaching Assistants from the various faculties in the university of Cape Coast who took the students through topics such as; How to manage pressure on campus, the power of networking, other opportunities one can explore on campus and how to achieve academic excellence. It was insightful, educative and eye opener. Our participants left the conference feeling excited and prepared to go through their journey and come out successful.</p>

                <p>In February 2022, The JARAB Foundation engaged 500+ Basic School Students in Amosima, Moree, Brafoyaw, in the Central Region of Ghana in peer mentorship and back to school donation.
                    We guided these children to set SMART goals for the academic year and designed action plan for them. In addition we donated exercise books, note books, pens, pencils, eraser, etc. to some needy students. We gave parcel award to best students in each school to encourage them and others to soar higher in their academics. It was impactful.</p>

Some dreams, goals, and aspirations receive life and are revamped because someone dropped some Oil to keep the fire  burning, and this is the greatest desire of the JARAB Foundation.Extra Oil Symposium is aimed at repositioning young ones who feel like giving up just because the going is getting tough and those that have their future getting dim because they don't have the fuel to spur on.
